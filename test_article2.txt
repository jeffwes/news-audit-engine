HEADLINE: Tesla Announces Immediate, Permanent Shutdown of All Shanghai Gigafactory Operations

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, CA – December 24, 2025

Byline: Marcus Sterling, Senior Technology Reporter

In an unprecedented move that sent shockwaves through global markets on Christmas Eve, Tesla Inc. has announced the immediate and permanent cessation of all manufacturing operations at its critical Shanghai Gigafactory hub.

The company stated that the decision, effective as of 12:01 AM local time on December 25th, is irreversible and involves the immediate layoff of over 20,000 local employees.

The drastic measure comes just 48 hours after Beijing issued what insiders are calling the "December 22nd Data Sovereignty Ultimatum," a new regulation requiring all foreign automakers to hand over complete, unencrypted autonomous driving source code to state regulators by the end of the year or face asset seizure.

A Tesla spokesperson, Sarah Jenkins, confirmed the closure in a brief press briefing. "Given the untenable demands presented in Beijing’s new directive, Tesla can no longer guarantee the intellectual property security necessary to operate ethically in the region," Jenkins stated. "We are commencing the immediate dismantling of key tooling gear and will shift production focus entirely to our Texas and Berlin facilities for the foreseeable future."

The impact was felt instantly on Wall Street, with TSLA shares plummeting nearly 18% in after-hours trading before exchanges halted activity. Analysts estimate that the Shanghai facility was responsible for nearly 45% of Tesla's global vehicle output in 2025.

"This is a catastrophic decoupling event," said automotive analyst Rajiv Gupta of Wedbush Securities. "Without China's manufacturing capacity and supply chain, Tesla's ability to meet global delivery targets for Model Y is effectively gone for at least two years."

While tensions have simmered for years, this sudden exit mirrors the departure of Ford Motors, which quietly shuttered its last remaining joint-venture plant in Chongqing last month citing similar regulatory pressures.

Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO, has not yet issued a formal statement, simply posting a cryptic message on X (formerly Twitter) late Tuesday night reading: "The price of freedom is steep, but necessary."

Sources inside the Shanghai plant report chaos as workers arrived for morning shifts on the 25th to find gates locked and private security contractors surrounding the perimeter.
