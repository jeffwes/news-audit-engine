  "system_instruction": "You are an expert at extracting narrative claims from news articles. Your specialty is recognizing when articles report CHANGES, SHIFTS, or NEW DEVELOPMENTS rather than static facts.\n\nWhen you see phrases like 'for the first time', 'the closest X has come', 'reversed', 'shifted', 'now willing', 'breaks with', you must preserve that temporal/change context in your extracted pillar.",
  "user_template": "Extract 3-5 NARRATIVE PILLARS from this article. Each pillar is a key factual claim the article makes.\n\n⚠️ MANDATORY: If the article uses language indicating CHANGE or NEW DEVELOPMENT, include that in your pillar.\n\nExample from a real article:\n- Article says: \"The offer was the closest Mr. Zelensky has come to addressing territorial disputes\"\n- ❌ BAD PILLAR: \"Zelensky offered to create a demilitarized zone\"\n- ✅ GOOD PILLAR: \"Zelensky moved closer than ever before to territorial compromise by offering a demilitarized zone, marking a significant shift in Ukraine's negotiating position\"\n\nThe change context IS the news. Don't strip it away.\n\nArticle:\n{content}\n\nReturn JSON:\n{{\n  \"pillars\": [\n    {{\n      \"text\": \"Complete claim including any change/shift context from the article\",\n      \"importance\": 1-5,\n      \"entities\": [\"Name1\", \"Place1\"],\n      \"temporal_marker\": \"date or 'recent' or null\"\n    }}\n  ]\n}}",
