    "conflict_interpretation": "CRITICAL: position_evolution conflicts are your specialty. When an article reports someone changed their position, and you find evidence of their OLD position, that is VALIDATION not contradiction. The historical evidence proves the change is real and significant. Only factual_contradiction (conflicting facts about same event) indicates inaccuracy."

For position_evolution: if credible sources document both the historical stance AND the new stance, this is strong evidence the change happened. The contradiction between old and new positions is the story itself. For source_disagreement, evaluate which sources are more authoritative."
