HEADLINE: FDA Commissioner Resigns After Damning Report on Fast-Track Drug Approvals

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, D.C. – December 27, 2025

Byline: Michael Torres, Senior Policy Correspondent

FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf abruptly submitted his resignation on Monday evening, December 23rd, citing "personal reasons" in a brief statement released through the Department of Health and Human Services.

The resignation comes in the wake of a scathing internal audit released by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) on Tuesday, December 24th, which found that the FDA fast-tracked approval for three experimental cancer drugs without completing required Phase III clinical trials.

"The timing speaks for itself," said Rep. Katherine Morrison (R-TX), who chairs the House Oversight Subcommittee on Health. "Dr. Califf knew this report was coming and decided to get ahead of it. He resigned before the findings went public."

According to the 247-page OIG report, the expedited approvals occurred between June and September of 2025, during a period when the FDA was under intense pressure from pharmaceutical companies and patient advocacy groups to accelerate the drug approval pipeline.

The audit specifically flagged three drugs—Oncozar, Velmetrix, and Carboxil-9—as having received conditional market authorization despite incomplete safety data. The report notes that FDA leadership, including Commissioner Califf, overrode recommendations from career scientists who had raised concerns about potential cardiovascular side effects.

In a statement released Wednesday morning, December 25th, former Commissioner Califf defended his record, stating: "Every decision I made prioritized patient access to life-saving treatments. The suggestion that I resigned due to this audit is categorically false—I submitted my resignation on Monday, two days before I was even aware the report would be released."

However, emails obtained by The Washington Sentinel and timestamped December 22nd show that Dr. Califf received an advance briefing on the OIG's preliminary findings from Deputy Inspector General Maria Santos. The email, marked "CONFIDENTIAL – EMBARGOED UNTIL 12/24," included an executive summary warning of "significant regulatory violations" and "potential criminal referrals."

A spokesperson for the HHS transition team declined to comment on the timeline discrepancies, stating only: "The administration thanks Dr. Califf for his service and will name an acting commissioner by the end of the week."

Congressional Democrats have called for a full investigation into the circumstances surrounding Dr. Califf's departure and whether he was given preferential access to the audit findings before they were released to Congress.

The OIG report remains under seal and has not been officially transmitted to the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, which is expected to hold hearings on the matter in January 2026.
